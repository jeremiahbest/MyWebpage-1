<p><font color="orange">My webpage is about my youtube channel and trying to learn how to make webpages. The reason I liked fortnite is becuase of the action fighting and graphics. I used to like fortnite because of building because i used to be good at it. I like some action games and some action movies. The action, fighting, and building is the reasons why I liked playing fortnite. I like coding and I like going outside. I have many videos on my channel and i will make more. I have another tab so click the video button to see videos. It is good to watch what you eat because you are what you eat</font></p>
