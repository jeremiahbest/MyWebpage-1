<p><font color="DarkOrange">The reason I liked fortnite is becuase of the action, gameplay, and graphics. I used to like fortnite because of gameplay and it was pretty fun. It was really cool looking at the graphics while playing it. I like action because I did not get bored of the game for a long time. The action, graphics, and gameplay are the reasons why I liked playing fortnite.</font></p> 
<p><font color="LimeGreen">My webpage is about my youtube channel and trying to learn how to make webpages. I like coding and I like going outside. I have many videos on my channel and I will make more. I have another tab so click the videos button to see videos. It is good to watch what you eat because you are what you eat</font></p>
